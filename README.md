orange (49 cents each), and banana (39 cents each) along with submit button. 
Each check boxes should have its own onclick event handler. 
These handlers must add the cost of their fruit to a total cost. 
An event handler for the submit button must produce an alert window with the 
message ‘your total cost is $xxx’, 
where xxx is the total cost of the chose fruit, including 5 percent sales tax.

the alert if errors are detected in the input data. Use CSS and event handlers to make your 
document appealing.

be a number from 1 to 6) 


6. Develop and demonstrate a HTML file which includes JavaScript that uses functions for the 
following problems:

above document so that when a text is moved from the top stacking position, it returns to its 
original position rather than to the bottom.


9.Develop a simple calculator to perform arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication and 
division) operations on given two numbers. Use an HTML tag that allows the user to input two 
numbers and to display the result of arithmetic operation. Write suitable HTML and JavaScript 
and CSS to your simple calculator. The following figure show sample document display.

#PART B
Develop a web application (mini-project) using the languages and concepts learnt in the theory 
and exercises listed in part A with a good look and feel effects. Database connection needs to be 
implemented. 
Note:

each student must demonstrate the project individually.
2. Each students has to execute one program picked from Part-A during the semester end 
examination. 
3. The team must submit a brief project report (20-25 pages) that must include the 
following 
 a. Introduction b. Requirement Analysis c Software Requirement Specification 
 d. Analysis and Design, e. Implementation f. Testing 
4. Brief synopsis not more than two pages to be submitted by the team as per the format 
given. It was recommended that students to do prior art search as part of literature 
survey before submitting the synopsis for the Mini/Major projects. 
5. Rubrics may be used to evaluate the Mini-Project
