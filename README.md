above document so that when a text is moved from the top stacking position, it returns to its 
original position rather than to the bottom.

examination. 
3. The team must submit a brief project report (20-25 pages) that must include the

 a. Introduction b. Requirement Analysis c Software Requirement Specification 
 d. Analysis and Design, e. Implementation f. Testing 
4. Brief synopsis not more than two pages to be submitted by the team as per the format 
given. It was recommended that students to do prior art search as part of literature 
survey before submitting the synopsis for the Mini/Major projects.
